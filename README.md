# ALT-Text-4-InDesign
**Adobe InDesign plugins that assists users in creating alternate text for accessible documents.**

Accessibility-4-InDesign currently contains two (independent) plugins: a [report panel](https://github.com/RolandDreger/accessibility-4-indesign) (with integrated question area) and this alt text panel. A plugin for contrast checking and preflights are currently being planned. The panels are intended to provide simple assistance in identifying accessibility issues in Adobe InDesign documents. 

However, some specific problems that cannot be solved with the built-in tools in InDesigns must be fixed in Acrobat, ePub editors or with the help of specialized further extensions. For example, InDesign cannot currently set the PDF/UA marker. Or InDesign has problems with making tables accessible for PDF.
