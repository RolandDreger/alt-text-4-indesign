# Privacy Policy

1. introduction

This privacy policy informs you about the type, scope and purpose of the processing of personal data in connection with the use of the Adobe InDesign plugin “ALT-Text-4-InDesign”.

2. Persons responsible

Roland Dreger, Tempelgasse 5, 1020 Vienna, Austria, email: roland.dreger@ik.me is responsible for data processing within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Please direct all data protection inquiries to this contact address.

3. Data collected and processed

The plugin does not collect any personal user data. Only the number of operations (creation of alternative texts) and the date of the last access are recorded for license verification purposes. Image files are transmitted to the OpenAI API in reduced form in order to generate alternative texts based on them.

4. Purpose of data processing

The recording of the number of accesses and the last access date serves exclusively to check and manage the license for the plugin. The transmission of the reduced image files to OpenAI takes place exclusively in order to be able to offer the automated creation of accessible alternative texts.

5. Transfer to third-party providers

The plugin uses a Large Language Model from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to generate the alternative texts. Only reduced (scaled, compressed) image data and no other user data is transmitted to OpenAI. OpenAI processes this data on behalf of the user. Your data will not be disclosed or passed on beyond this.

6. Data security

Technical and organizational measures are taken to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss or manipulation. Your image data is transmitted to OpenAI in encrypted form via a secure API connection.

7. Storage duration

The stored license verification data (number of accesses and last access date) is stored for the entire service life of the plugin and deleted after the license period has expired. The image files transmitted to OpenAI are only stored locally and temporarily on your computer and are automatically deleted after InDesign is closed. [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) only stores data in accordance with its own terms of use and privacy policy.

8. Your rights

You have the right to information about the data stored by us and to rectification, erasure or restriction of processing. You can also object to data processing at any time and request data portability, insofar as this is technically possible.

9. Amendments to this privacy policy

This privacy policy may be amended if necessary, for example if the plug-in functionality is expanded or legal requirements change. The current version can be viewed at any time on the [ALT-Text-4-InDesign website](https://github.com/RolandDreger/alt-text-4-indesign).

10. Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about data protection, you can contact the data protection officer at any time (see contact above).
